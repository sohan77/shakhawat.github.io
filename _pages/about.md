# 💬 CREATIVE WORKS 
- * Regulation of Degradation Behavior and Stress Modulation of 3D Printed Magnesium Alloys for
 Enhanced Bone Regeneration * This research investigates the degradation behavior of 3D-printed magnesium (Mg) alloys under tensile stress and pressure, simulating the conditions of bone implants in the femoral region. When Mg alloys are implanted, they
 experience mechanical stress from body movements like walking and running. These stresses influence the rate of
 degradation, which is crucial for ensuring the implant provides adequate support while allowing for proper bone
 healing. By applying tensile and compressive forces to Mg specimens, this study aims to better understand how
 mechanical loading impacts the degradation process, helping to optimize Mg alloy implants for improved bone
 regeneration and long-term performance.
